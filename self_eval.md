# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods? **Not very confident as I feel there are too many to be fully aware of.  If they aren't used that often then they might be forgotten. I also have used a few and I don;t feel fully aware of their functions.**
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own? **I feel pretty good, as I can define what they do.  Sometimes when a challenge is asking us to create methods with specific functions that can be tricky.**
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!) **Can you cascade methods?  Like string them together?  If so, how many can you link together?**
